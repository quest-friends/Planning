Project Description
-------------------
Dev Quest is an interactive system designed to portray the journey of learning software development in a lighthearted way. More specifically, it's a 2D roguelike built in react-redux. It incorporates traditional roguelike elements with general programming concepts. 

The app is designed specifically to work in desktop computer web browsers. It's responsive but doesn't support mobile devices.
