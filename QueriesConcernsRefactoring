### GameConnector - unnecessary props mapped in from state
issue: we're currently passing in two unnecessary bits of the state (via MapStateToProps) - state.player.position.x and .y
this is to trigger the re-render of the Game->Board components in response to player movement
(apparently due to component not noticing a change in the bigger object, despite the x or y value changing)
why refactor needed: seems stupid to map extra props when we won't ever use them
