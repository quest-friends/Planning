Board rendering logic: currently rendering tiles and player and stuff all in one step.

Suggested change (pseudocode) - this is refactoring, should be done at some point

map through tile containers
  
  map through board
    render tiles

  map through player (grid coords)
    render player
    
  map through enemies (grid coords)
    render enemies
    
  etc
