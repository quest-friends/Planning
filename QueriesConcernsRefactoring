### GameConnector - unnecessary props mapped in from state [noted by Madeleine]
issue: we're currently passing in two unnecessary bits of the state (via MapStateToProps) - state.player.position.x and .y
this is to trigger the re-render of the Game->Board components in response to player movement
(apparently due to component not noticing a change in the bigger object, despite the x or y value changing)
why refactor needed: seems stupid to map extra props when we won't ever use them


### Unused reducer files
currently we've uncombined all our reducers, but not removed the old files. We've left them in place because we do want to
recombine the reducers at some point but only after we've actually implemented our own combined reducer, and a lot of other
work depends on being able to access particular parts of the state (ie tilegrid from within the player movement reducer)
which the standard implementation of combinereducers does not allow us to do.
