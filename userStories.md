At this point these can / should be very brainstormy. Throw any ideas in here, we'll thin them out later...

 As a user...

I see start screen with 'Welcome' text and I can click button to start game
then I arrive at a screen with a gameboard (fresh each time, two rooms) and see my character in the first room
I start with a fixed number of health points
I can see my health points on screen as a simple counter
I can see the exit tile in the second room and static location of opponents within rooms
I can move my character from tile to tile using arrow keys
I can only move my character to tiles that are either rooms or corridors
if my character is in a tile adjacent to an opponent, it can hit me at the cost of one health point
I can hit an opponent by walking over its tile (and/or stab it as part of moving onto its tile)
my health can reach zero and I can die

I can reach the exit square and a new screen explains I've won, and clicking a button gives me acccess to a new level (for MVP this is just a new gameboard)
when I die, I see a screen that explains I've lost, and clicking a button gives me a new gameboard


For future stuff:
- my health is expressed in terms of nerd cred
- I can see some information about how to play the game (e.g. arrow keys)
- I can walk over items (such as coffee) to increase my health
- I can login and my previous achievements are loaded
- on the start screen I can use buttons to choose player
